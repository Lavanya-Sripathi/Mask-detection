# 😷 Face Mask Detection using YOLOv8

An impactful computer vision project — **detecting face masks using YOLOv8!**

This project applies deep learning to automatically identify whether individuals are wearing face masks. It’s a crucial task for maintaining **public safety**, ensuring **health compliance**, and assisting in **automated monitoring** during pandemics.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ⚡️ Built using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8)** for real-time object detection
- 🧠 Trained on images of people with/without masks
- 📦 Model detects:
  - ✅ With Mask
  - ❌ Without Mask
- 🔬 fast inference speed

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- Google Colab (for training and experimentation)
- Deep Learning, Computer Vision

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- `mask.ipynb` – Main training/testing notebook
- `runs/` – Contains model results and trained weights
- `images/` – Sample input images (optional)
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or open in Colab:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lavanya-Sripathi/Mask-detection.git

    ```
2. Run `mask.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally
3. Upload your dataset or use the sample one
4. Train the YOLOv8 model
5. Test it on new images or video
