# 😷 Face Mask Detection using YOLOv8

An impactful computer vision project — **detecting face masks using YOLOv8!**

This project applies deep learning to automatically identify whether individuals are wearing face masks. It’s a crucial task for maintaining **public safety**, ensuring **health compliance**, and assisting in **automated monitoring** during pandemics.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ⚡️ Built using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8)** for real-time object detection
- 🧠 Trained on images of people with/without masks
- 📦 Model detects:
  - ✅ With Mask
  - ❌ Without Mask
- 🔬 Fast inference speed

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- Google Colab (for training and experimentation)
- Deep Learning, Computer Vision

   Or run this command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lavanya-Sripathi/Mask-detection.git
3. Run `mask.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally
4. Use the pre-trained mask.pt model file
5. Train the YOLOv8 model
6. Test it on new images or video

## 📸 Sample Output

| Input Image | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| 👤 Person without mask | ❌ Detected as "No Mask" |                  
| 😷 Person with mask     | ✅ Detected as "Mask On" |
